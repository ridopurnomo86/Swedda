                        <p>Sales Managers&nbsp;sell products and services to customers on behalf of a company, usually 
                        developing a unique skillset to find unique ways of developing and sustaining relationships and 
                        trust to obtain sales and increase an audience or database.&nbsp;Sales Managers are also commonly 
                        referred to as Area Managers.&nbsp; A Sales Manager may be responsible for overseeing a department 
                        within a store or specialising in managing the sales within a division of a company, whereas an 
                        Area Manager manages sales to clients at local, regional, or national levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 32px;">Sales Managers and Area Managers work closely with management to determine KPIs and sales targets 
                        and may consult with the marketing team to decide on appropriate marketing campaigns.&nbsp; They pursue 
                        new business and solve the customers problem by introducing them to a service or product.&nbsp; &nbsp;
                        They answer questions, offer alternative solutions, discuss bulk discounts, and disclose periodical 
                        promotions. They build relationships and ensure a smooth&nbsp;sales&nbsp;process, processing, or 
                        organising payment or setting up an account.&nbsp; Sales Managers will seek out new&nbsp;leads, 
                        through business directories, client referrals, and networking.&nbsp; They can work in a B2C 
                        (Business to Consumer) environment or B2B (Business to Business).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales Managers 
                        are also often responsible for overseeing Sales Representatives within their team or region, ensuring 
                        they follow company protocol, achieve set targets and act as an Ambassador for the company.&nbsp; This 
                        aspect of the role may involve team leadership meetings, coaching, mentoring, training, and guidance.</p>

                        <p>Sales manager's role is one of the most complex role in the organization, they need to manage their target, recruit , 
                        motivate and train the salespeople, manage the operation process, handling complaints, execute marketing strategies and be a 
                        customer champion and compliance officer, the list can go on and on. Hence, it is a mistake to assume that the top sales person 
                        can automatically resume the role of sales managers without much training and coaching, in fact, many times, the characteristics 
                        that contribute to the success of an outstanding salespeople work against him or her in the role of sales manager. I have&nbsp;seen 
                        an outstanding sales person with high competency,&nbsp;strong performer, strong sense of self-worth and look for recognition for 
                        personal sales achievements did not enjoy the role of sales managers which required him to achieve the result through others. Hence, 
                        the company and mangers should provide a transition training for sales person who promoted to be sales manager 
                        (<em>Training : Transition to Sales Managers</em>). </p><br>
                        <p>One of the uniqueness about sales manager role's is that, they are leading team of 6-10 people who are closest to the customers 
                        and market, where the action take place.&nbsp;I believe, no sales strategies or tactical plan can be executed well nor marketing 
                        messages can reach to the target segment without the sales manager's involvement, it is their role to ensure that the sales team 
                        activities is aligned with the sales objectives and company objectives, they are also the one who can provide very valuable information 
                        of customer's feedback, competitor and market information to the marketing team and company. Hence It is important to ensure that sales 
                        managers are well trained, because poor management ability and demotovating leadership styles can quickly bring down the performance of 
                        a sales team and affect retention as well. Numerous research studies have shown that employees quit because of their relationship with 
                        their manager, not because of job factors or compensation. Good sales management training programs that include hiring, managing, coaching 
                        and leadership skills can create possible ripple effect in the organization by creating more effective managers and leaders.</p>
